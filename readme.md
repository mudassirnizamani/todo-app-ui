This is a Todo App created in React, and I am building this app for an exercise.

This app is bootstrapped with ['vite'](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
Go to the root directory of the app and just type

`yarn`

Second, run the development server:

`yarn dev`
